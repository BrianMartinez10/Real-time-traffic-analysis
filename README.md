Real-Time-Traffic-Analysis
Project Bhavik Application Design for Big Data This project focuses on analyzing real-time traffic data to assist emergency vehicles and other priority traffic. Unlike Google Maps, which serves the general commuting public, this system is designed specifically to offer enhanced support for time-sensitive routes and incident response.

Team Lead: Andres

This project uses a dataset from Kaggle on US traffic accidents and incorporates additional traffic data from various sources to monitor congestion levels, predict accident risks, and provide optimized routing for emergency responders.

Key Features Traffic Heat Map: Displays real-time traffic density and congestion hotspots. Accident Risk Indicators: Predicts potential accident zones using historical data, weather, and road conditions. Optimized Routing Suggestions: Offers dynamic routing for emergency vehicles based on real-time data. Real-Time Updates: Refreshes traffic data to ensure up-to-date routing and incident predictions. Data Sources US Accident Data: Kaggle Traffic APIs: Ontario 511, Metrolinx, HERE Traffic, and Google Maps Traffic API. City Open Data: City of Toronto Open Data Portal for localized traffic and incident information. Technologies Used Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js Backend: Python, Flask Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn Visualizations: Real-time dashboards, charts for traffic analysis Project Structure
